    <h2>Tom And Jerry</h2>
    <article>
        <p>Tom & Jerry Kids (formerly known as Tom & Jerry Kids Show in the first season) is an American animated comedy
            television series co-produced by Hanna-Barbera and Turner Entertainment Co., and starring the cat-and-mouse
            duo Tom and Jerry as toddlers (toddler kitten and baby mouse).It premiered on Fox on September 8, 1990,
            airing as the first program of the children's programming block, Fox Kids,and was the second Tom and
            Jerry TV series to be produced by Hanna-Barbera following The Tom and Jerry Show in 1975.

            The series is somewhat similar to the "older" version of the original theatricals, partly akin to being
            produced by creators William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, founders of Hanna-Barbera and former MGM cartoon
            studio staff.The Tom and Jerry Kids cartoons are based on the classic shorts, Tom and Jerry, but it stars
            the kitten and mouseling instead. They remain silent like their older selves and both of them are attempting
            to outwit each other, exactly like in the original shorts. Some of the plots and gags are recycled from old
            Tom and Jerry cartoons, but the violence is toned down for younger viewers</p>
