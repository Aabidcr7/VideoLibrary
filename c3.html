    <h2>Minions The Competition</h2>
    <article>
        <p>In "The Competition," a short film featuring the Minions from the Despicable Me franchise, two Minions
            compete against each other to become the best employee at Gru's laboratory. Kevin and Stuart go head-to-head
            in a series of wacky and dangerous experiments, trying to impress their boss and earn the title of "Employee
            of the Month." The experiments range from shrinking and enlarging objects to creating a serum that turns
            things invisible. The two Minions sabotage each other's experiments and create chaos in the lab. In the end,
            Gru declares that there is no winner, as he values the teamwork and dedication of all his employees. The
            short film is a fun and lighthearted addition to the Despicable Me franchise, featuring the beloved and
            mischievous Minions in their signature style of slapstick humor and zany antics.</p>
