    <h2>Different</h2>
    <article>
        <p>The following short film, “Different”, by Lake Nona Campus student Tahneek Rahman, was honored with the
            distinction of “Best in Show” at the recent Reel Short Teen Film Festival. It was also an official selection
            at the All American High School Film Festival and the Brouhaha Film & Video Showcase.Tahneek explains: “With
            this film, I wanted to share a message that despite our differences, we can all still live in a world where
            we can work together for the greater good. Given the past Presidential election, I felt that this film was
            appropriate and should serve as a reminder that we are all unique. I wanted to create a scenario that was
            different and I wanted the characters to compliment each other, even with their differences. This was the
            final product and it is my favorite project thus far!”</p>
