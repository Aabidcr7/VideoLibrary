    <h2>coin operated - animated short film</h2>
    <article>
        <p>TA young boy sees a rocket kiddie ride at a grocery store. The boy is an aspiring astronaut, and with 5 cents
            in his pocket, he dispenses the coin and rides it. He is disappointed when the ride does not launch him into
            space, but instead merely wobbles somewhat for a few seconds.

            Expecting that the ride can do better, he opens a lemonade stand and earns money from it. This goes on until
            the boy has become an old man. Having earned lots of money to produce more launch attempts, he goes back to
            the ride and fills it with coins. It wobbles like usual at first, but soon shakes violently and launches him
            into space. A brief shot from the clouds displays him as a young boy again.</p>
