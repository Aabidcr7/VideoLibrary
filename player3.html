    <h2>The Present</h2>
    <article>
        <p>A 12-year-old boy plays a shooter video game in a darkened living room behind blinds, but is surprised when
            his mother arrives with a box, saying it contains a present for him. She then goes upstairs to answer a
            phone call. The boy opens the box, revealing an energetic young puppy. The boy's delight turns to disgust
            however, as he sees the puppy is missing most of his left front leg. He tosses the puppy away and continues
            playing his game. Unperturbed, the puppy finds a red rubber ball under a cabinet and walks up to the boy,
            carrying the rubber ball and inviting him to play. The boy does his best to ignore the puppy but is soon won
            over by his determination and spirit, in spite of himself. The boy shuts off the video game and decides to
            go outside to play fetch with his dog, where it is revealed that he walks with crutches, as his left leg has
            been amputated below the knee.</p>
