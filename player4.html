    <h2>Routine</h2>
    <article>
        <p>This animation is about a young man trapped in a daily routine where every single day is so very similar to
            the previous one. There are no happiness, satisfaction and love for a long time in his life because of such
            a routine days, weeks, months and even years. One day, his ordinary life has taken on a visible form. The
            routine has looked like a strange monster that is daily growing. His arms and legs are getting longer and
            sight is getting more threatening. The immutability of the young man’s life caused monster to grow fast with
            every day of his life. The monster has been always beside a tired man and did not leave him even for a
            single moment. Even more, this routine has began to control man’s life and now it’s too late - there is no
            chance to change something ... Every one of us has probably had that kind of routine days. It depends on our
            patience, strength and decisions if we want to withstand the effect of this problem and change something in
            our lives.</p>
